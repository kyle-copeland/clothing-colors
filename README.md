# Clothing Colors 

A visual way for me to document clothing color combinations I've seen people wear on the streets.
Bonus: a potential piece of art.

ðŸŸª = ðŸ‘š = Shirt

ðŸŸ¦ = ðŸ‘– = Pants

ðŸŸ« = ðŸ‘ž = Shoes

## Technical Motivation
The web is starting to catch up in native tooling (web components/css variables) and I'm interested in learning how useful those are compared to open-source frameworks (transpilers/React/CSS-In-JS). The web tooling eco-system has become complex and unfriendly to new developers. Maybe these new browser supported tools will make web development more approachable for newcomers by reducing the number of dependencies required to bootstrap a project.
